## Predictive Framework for Liquid-Liquid Equilibrium (LLE)

This project implements a predictive framework designed to model and simulate Liquid-Liquid Equilibrium (LLE) in chemical systems. LLE refers to the state where two immiscible liquids coexist at equilibrium with a specific composition of each phase. This framework is built to predict the composition and phase behavior of the liquid mixtures based on provided input data such as temperature, pressure, and component concentrations.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** The framework includes preprocessing techniques to clean and structure experimental LLE data.
- **Predictive Modeling:** A machine learning model is employed to predict equilibrium compositions, ensuring accurate phase separation outcomes.
- **Visualization:** Tools are provided to visualize phase behavior diagrams and compare predicted values with experimental results.
- **Modularity:** The framework is designed to be flexible, allowing the addition of new models and datasets.
- **Performance Optimization:** The code is optimized for speed and accuracy, making it suitable for both academic and industrial use.
